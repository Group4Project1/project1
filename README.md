## Project Title

A Better Movie Streaming Experience

## Project Description

Have you ever found yourself spending too much time searching for just the right movie or show over all your entertainment streaming apps (Netflix, Hulu, HBO, Amazon Prime, etc.)? If your answer is yes, this application that we are proposing will make your movie streaming experience better!!

### Our Added-Value Purpose

The goal of this project would be to develop a responsive application the would allow users to search through the content of their various movie streaming apps to help them find the right movie or show to watch according to the following selection criteria:

- Movie streaming app (i.e. Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime, etc.)
- Genre
- Movie vs show series
- Assigned movie rating (G, PG, PG-13, R)

## APIs to be Used

It was a challenge for our team to find a completely free (i.e. no quota) API that had the movie/app streaming data. Nevertheless, we were able to find and use the two API's listed below to design our web app. Please reference the "Lessons Learned" section below for a better understanding of the API limitations our team faced and how we pivoted to meet out project's MVP requirements.

### APIs for Streaming Apps

- IMDb API - [https://rapidapi.com/apidojo/api/imdb8](https://rapidapi.com/apidojo/api/imdb8)
- The Movie Database API - [https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction)
